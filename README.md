# basalt
Basalt is a small stage 3 build based on the lfs project up to chapter 8 of the installation. It also includes a small package manager of the same name.

- Binaries for kernel
- WIP

At the moment we only provide the amd64 images, but in the future we want to expand it to aarch64. (mostly raspberry pi)
