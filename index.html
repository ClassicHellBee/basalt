    <h1>Home</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Basalt Linux project, a source-based distro.</p>
    <p>Basalt is a small stage 3 build of the lfs project up to chapter 8 of the installation. It also includes a small package manager of the same name.</p>
    <p>2025-07-21: We've updated the download server to MediaFire, and will replace it with something compatible with wget later.</p>
    <p>2025-07-22: We've released a new stage3 image with the packages needed to build the rest of the system, all located in /sources.</p>
    <p>2025-07-25: Finally, we're happy to announce that we've updated the handbook and released stage 3 with the package manager. The documentation is still being created... :)</p>
    <p>2025-07-28: From the Basalt project, we would like to announce that we have now released the image with our Basalt package manager, correcting errors from previous releases that prevented it from running correctly.</p>
